# PS4API - Server

This is the payload that handles all server code for my <b><i>(very basic)PS4API</i></b>. It is built upon kr105rlz's PS4-dlclose exploit, so huge thanks to him for that code!!!!

This is meant to be compiled using CTurt's PS4 SDK. https://github.com/CTurt/PS4-SDK however, I am sure you could migrate it to another sdk such as psxdev's sdk. 

Again, I want to say thanks to the following people for their help in the PS4 Community: 2much4u, Bad ChoicesZ, CTurt, qwertyoruiop, kr105rlz, Z80, and Zecaxco
